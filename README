Project 4 -- Lob Pong
Lab: Tues. & Thurs. 12:30-1:45
TA: Patrick Conway
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

User's Guide:
When the program is executed a GUI opens with instructions on how to play and options to change the color of the ball or the paddle.
When the user presses "Play!" a new window opens and the game starts immediately.
The paddle can be moved with the arrow keys or 'WASD'. The goal is to keep the ball in the air for as long as possible. 
Their is a lives tracker, countdown timer, and lives tracker at the top. 
If you keep the ball in the air when the countdown reaches zero, you move to the next level and the timer is reset with 5 seconds above the previous timer.
When the ball falls out of the screen, you lose a life and the game resets to the level you were just on.
When your lives reaches zero, the game ends. 
The game becomes harder each level because you must keep the ball in the air for even more time.

Two primary classes: 'PongGUI' and 'PongGame'. 
'PongGame' has 'Canvas' class nested inside it.

The main method is located in PongGUI class. It creates an instance of itself and sets visible. 
The constructor creates the labels, combo boxes, and button and uses a box layout.
The user can choose the color of the ball and the paddle or leave them at the default black.
When the user presses the 'Play!' button and an instance of 'PongGame' is created, opening a new window. Ball and paddle color are passed in.
The initial angle is randomly chosen from possible angles. The game starts immediately.
Each time the player makes it to the next level more time is added to the countdown timer.
When the ball falls out of the screen the game resets (except the levels are kept and countdown timer is set to it's previous value).
When the user loses all three lives, the game ends.
